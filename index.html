                    <h4>Kamikatsu, Japan</h4>
                    <p>Perhaps one of the most well-known zero-waste communities outside of the United States, the village of Kamikatsu made a zero-waste declaration back in 2003 and never looked back.<br> Behind the US, Japan is the second-largest producer of plastic in the world and incinerates 78% of solid waste (including some recyclables). However, this remote village has managed to buck the trend and recycle, compost, or reuse more than 80% of its waste through a truly comprehensive zero-waste program. <br> Residents famously sort garbage into 45 different types, pulling apart items made from multiple materials and washing everything before sending it to a central recycling station. The community also focuses on reducing waste through initiatives like distributing cloth diapers to new parents and a “swap-shop” where residents can leave unneeded items for others to take for free.</p>

                    <h4>Vancouver, Canada</h4>
                    <p>The Metro Vancouver federation pledged to go zero waste in 2006, and between then and 2018 successfully reduced the amount of waste that was landfilled or incinerated by over 32%.<br> In 2018 the city went a step further by introducing Zero Waste 2040, a comprehensive long-term strategy to push Vancouver towards zero waste to landfill within the next twenty years.<br> This ambitious plan goes beyond simple waste management, fostering a culture of zero waste through system-wide change encouraging waste prevention through an operational model within the local government that can be replicated by other organizations.<br> Metro Vancouver also helped found Canada's National Zero Waste Council, which hopes to support the transition to a circular economy through collaborations that promote sustainable designs and behaviors.</p>
